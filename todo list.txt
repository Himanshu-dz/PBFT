0) Understanding the concept of signature hashing and keys ----done----
1) Create a BootSTrapServer : [Nodes are able to register themselves->generate public key using eliptic curve cryptography->public key will be stored in blockchain database permanently
                               ||Nodes are able to take part in consenus algorithm]
    -> We will use p2p Server 

2) Modifying data to money transfer 
3) Verifying transactions as well
4) Creating local databases for storing blockchain
